Local broadcasts can be used as a general-purpose pub/sub event bus in the app without any overheads of system-wide broadcasts.\n\nDo not broadcast sensitive information using an implicit intent.

To enable the most restrictive (and therefore secure) policy, use the signature permissions to minimize the number of exported intents.<br><br>If you do not need to send broadcasts to components outside of your app, then send and receive local broadcasts with the LocalBroadcastManager, which is available in the Support Library. The LocalBroadcastManager is much more efficient (no interprocess communication needed) and allows you to avoid any security issues related to other apps being able to receive or send your broadcasts. Local broadcasts can be used as a general purpose pub/sub event bus in your app without any overheads of system-wide broadcasts.<br><br>When you register a receiver, any app can send potentially malicious broadcasts to your app's receiver. Here are some ways to limit the broadcasts that your app receives:<br><br>- Specify a permission when registering a broadcast receiver.\r\n- For manifest-declared receivers, set the android:exported attribute to \"false\" in the manifest. The receiver does not receive broadcasts from sources outside of the app.\r\n- Limit yourself to only local broadcasts with LocalBroadcastManager.\r\n- Specify a permission when registering a broadcast receiver.<br><br>\uD83D\uDFE6&nbsp;Code Snippet<br><br>\uD83D\uDFE7&nbsp;com.android.insecurebankv2.MyBroadCastReceiver(Showing 11 lines of 34)<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;package
